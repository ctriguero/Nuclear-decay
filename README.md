# Nuclear-decay
## Learn about nuclear decay by doing different simulations of stochastic processes. The package is composed by different programs.

## (1) Decay of one nucleus.

- Learn how to obtain the **distribution of durations**, D(t), for different decay probabilities.
- Compare the obtained distributions with the **[binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,%2Fone%20(with%20probability%20p))**. Fit parameters.

## (2) Decay of an arbitrary number of nucleus.
