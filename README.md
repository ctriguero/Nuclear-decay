# Nuclear-decay
## Learn about nuclear decay by doing different simulations of stochastic processes. The package is composed by different programs.

## (1) Decay of one nucleus.

- Obtain the distribution of durations, D(t), for different decay probabilities.
- Compare the obtained distributions with the binomial distribution. Fit parameters.
